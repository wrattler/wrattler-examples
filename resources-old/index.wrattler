#### Introducing Wrattler

The following notebooks illustrate some of the basic Wrattler functionality.
Start here to learn how to edit code in Wrattler, re-evaluate notebooks and
create data visualizations.

 * [Getting started with Wrattler](?welcome) -
   This notebook explains the basics of using Wrattler.
   If you are new to Wrattler, this is the best place to start!
 * [Exploring the dependency graph](?dependency) -
   This notebook is the perfect playground for exploring how
   the dependency graph and re-evaluation in Wrattler works.
 * [Data visualization with Wrattler](?charts) -
   You can use a wide range of data visualization tools with
   Wrattler, including Plotly, ggplot2 and Matplotlib.


#### Loading data into Wrattler

If you want to play with Wrattler on your own, then the following notebooks
are a good place to start. They show you a couple examples of loading various
fun sample input data into a notebook.

 * [Accessing sample R datasets](?rdata) - one of the easiest way of getting
   interesting sample data is to load the pre-defined R datasets.
 * [Downloading data using Python](?pydata) -  this file shows how to download
   various interesting datasets from the internet so that you can play with them.

#### Sample data analyses

This section contains larger data analyses created using Wrattler that use
the unique features provided by Wrattler such as the ability to create polyglot
notebooks.

 * [Analysing broadband quality in the UK](?broadband) -
   In this notebook, we analyse the difference between internet
   quality in rural and urban areas between 2014 and 2015.

#### Data Wrangling tools

Wrattler is a part of project that aims to build a variety of tools to simplify
tedious data wrangling and cleaning tasks. The following notebooks show some of
the other tools that we build, integrated into Wrattler:

 * [Joining data using datadiff](?datadiff) - Datadiff identifies structural differences
    between pairs of (related) tabular data sets and returns an executable patch.
 * [Better CSV parsing with CleverCSV](?cleverCSV) - This notebook shows the use of the
   CleverCSV tool, which is a replacement for the standard Python csv module.

#### Empty notebooks

 * [Open an empty notebook](?empty) - This opens an empty Wrattler notebook where
   you can add JavaScript, Python, R and Markdown cells as you wish.
